# SUDOKU
Sudoku Project

first day building a working sudoku :

- html and CSS is mostly done, looks good enough for now
- input is working
- detects invalid numbers

to do : 
- basically all the js stuff
- add rules for duplicate numbers
- build the check button
- build the reset button
- add random numbers to get interesting grids (must study how sudokus work a bit..)
- maybe add a hint / help / solution system
- ranking / leaderboard system
- add cookies or a way to survive refreshes (only reset button must wipe board)
- bigger boards with difficulty settings
