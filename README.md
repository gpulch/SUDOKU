# YURI'S SUDOKU
YURI'S SUDOKU Project

Building a working sudoku in javascript :

done :
- HTML and CSS is mostly done, looks good enough for now
- input is working
- detects invalid numbers

to do : 
- basically all the js stuff
- add rules for duplicate numbers
- build the check button
- build the reset button
- add random numbers to get actual interesting grids (must study how sudokus work a bit..)
- add a way to survive refreshes (only reset button must wipe board)

to maybe do :
- bigger boards with difficulty settings
- maybe add a hint / help / solution system
- timing / ranking / leaderboard system
